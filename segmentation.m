Hi all, I've been trying to figure out how segmentation CNNs work. I have a good understanding of how CNNs work in labelling an input image, but am confused how segmentation networks are able to assign a label to each pixel? How is the data passed into the network? Is it based on some sliding kernel where sections of the image are passed in? Any good papers I can read to figure this out?
